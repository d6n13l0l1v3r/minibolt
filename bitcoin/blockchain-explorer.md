# 2.3 Blockchain explorer: BTC RPC Explorer

Run your own private blockchain explorer with [BTC RPC Explorer](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer). Trust your node, not some external services.

## Run your own blockchain explorer

After the MiniBolt runs your own fully validated node, and even acts as a backend for your hardware wallet with Fulcrum, the last important puzzle piece to improve privacy and financial sovereignty is your own Blockchain Explorer. It lets you query transactions, addresses, and blocks of your choice. You no longer need to leak information by querying a third-party blockchain explorer that can be used to get your location and cluster addresses.

[BTC RPC Explorer](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer) provides a lightweight and easy to use web interface to accomplish just that. It's a database-free, self-hosted Bitcoin blockchain explorer, querying Bitcoin Core and Fulcrum via RPC.

## Preparations

### **Install Node.js + NPM**

Node.js package includes NPM, follow the [Node.js + NPM bonus guide](../bonus/system/nodejs-npm.md)

### **Reverse proxy & Firewall**

In the security[ section](broken-reference/), we set up Nginx as a reverse proxy. Now we can add the BTC RPC Explorer configuration.

*   Enable the Nginx reverse proxy to route external encrypted HTTPS traffic internally to the BTC RPC Explorer. The `error_page 497` directive instructs browsers that send HTTP requests to resend them over HTTPS.

    ```sh
    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/btcrpcexplorer-reverse-proxy.conf
    ```

    ```nginx
    server {
      listen 4000 ssl;
      error_page 497 =301 https://$host:$server_port$request_uri;
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3002;
      }
    }
    ```
*   Test and reload Nginx configuration

    ```sh
    $ sudo nginx -t
    ```

    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```
*   Configure the firewall to allow incoming HTTPS requests

    ```sh
    $ sudo ufw allow 4000/tcp comment 'allow BTC RPC Explorer SSL from anywhere'
    ```

## BTC RPC Explorer

### **Installation**

For improved security, we create the new user "btcrpcexplorer" that will run the block explorer. Using a dedicated user limits potential damage in case there's a security vulnerability in the code. An attacker would not be able to do much within this user's permission settings.

*   Create a new user, assign it to the "bitcoin" group, and open a new session

    ```sh
    $ sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" btcrpcexplorer
    ```

    ```sh
    $ sudo adduser btcrpcexplorer bitcoin
    ```

    ```sh
    $ sudo su - btcrpcexplorer
    ```
* Set a temporary version environment variable to the installation

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>$ VERSION=3.4.0
</strong></code></pre>

* Import the GPG key of the developer

```bash
$ curl https://github.com/janoside.gpg | gpg --import
```

*   Download the source code directly from GitHub and install all dependencies using the Node Package Manager (NPM)

    ```sh
    $ git clone --branch v$VERSION https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer.git
    ```

    <pre><code><strong>$ cd btc-rpc-explorer
    </strong></code></pre>


* Verify the release

```bash
$ git verify-commit v$VERSION
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Jun 14 15:18:11 2023 CEST
gpg:                using EDDSA key 4D841E6E6B1B68EBFAB4A9E670C0B166321C0AF8
gpg: Good signature from "Dan Janosik <dan@47.io>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 4D84 1E6E 6B1B 68EB FAB4  A9E6 70C0 B166 321C 0AF8
```

* Install all dependencies using NPM

```sh
$ npm install
```

Installation can take some time, be patient. There might be a lot of confusing output, but if you see something similar to the following, the installation was successful

**Example** of expected output:

```
> Installed to /home/btcrpcexplorer/btc-rpc-explorer/node_modules/node-sass/vendor/linux-amd64-83/binding.node
> added 480 packages from 307 contributors and audited 482 packages in 570.14s
>
> 43 packages are looking for funding
>   run `npm fund` for details
>
> found 12 vulnerabilities (8 moderate, 4 high)
>   run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
```

### **Configuration**

*   Copy and edit the configuration template (skip this step when updating). Activate any setting by removing the `#` at the beginning of the line.

    ```sh
    $ cp .env-sample .env
    ```

    ```sh
    $ nano /home/btcrpcexplorer/btc-rpc-explorer/.env --linenumbers
    ```
*   Instruct BTC RPC Explorer to connect to local Bitcoin Core.

    ```
    # uncomment these lines
    BTCEXP_BITCOIND_HOST=127.0.0.1
    BTCEXP_BITCOIND_PORT=8332
    # replace this line
    BTCEXP_BITCOIND_COOKIE=/data/bitcoin/.cookie
    ```
*   To get address balances, either an Electrum server or an external service is necessary. Your local Electrum server can provide address transaction lists, balances, and more.

    ```
    # replace these lines
    BTCEXP_ADDRESS_API=electrum
    BTCEXP_ELECTRUM_SERVERS=tcp://127.0.0.1:50001
    ```
*   Uncomment this line

    ```
    BTCEXP_SLOW_DEVICE_MODE=false
    ```

#### **Optional**

* You can decide whether you want to optimize for more information or more privacy.
  *   More information mode, including Bitcoin exchange rates

      ```
      # replace these lines
      BTCEXP_PRIVACY_MODE=false
      BTCEXP_NO_RATES=false
      ```
  *   More privacy mode, no external queries

      ```
      # uncomment these lines
      BTCEXP_PRIVACY_MODE=true
      BTCEXP_NO_RATES=true
      ```
*   You can add password protection to the web interface. Simply add your password \[D] for the following option, for which the browser will then prompt you. You can enter any user name; only the password is checked.

    ```
    # replace `mypassword` with 'YourPassword [D] in this line
    BTCEXP_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=YourPassword [D]
    ```
*   Decide whether you prefer a `light` or `dark` theme by default. Left uncommented to dark (default dark)

    ```
    # uncomment and replace this line with your selection
    BTCEXP_UI_THEME=dark
    ```
* Save and exit
*   Exit the "btcrpcexplorer" user session to return to the "admin" user session

    ```sh
    $ exit
    ```

### **Autostart on boot**

Now we'll make sure our blockchain explorer starts as a service on the PC so that it's always running.

*   As user "admin", create the service file

    ```sh
    $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/btcrpcexplorer.service
    ```
*   Paste the following configuration. Save and exit

    ```
    # MiniBolt: systemd unit for BTC RPC Explorer
    # /etc/systemd/system/btcrpcexplorer.service

    [Unit]
    Description=BTC RPC Explorer
    After=bitcoind.service fulcrum.service

    [Service]
    User=btcrpcexplorer
    WorkingDirectory=/home/btcrpcexplorer/btc-rpc-explorer
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=30

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
*   Enable autoboot

    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl enable btcrpcexplorer
    ```
*   Prepare "btcrpcexplorer" monitoring by the systemd journal and check log logging output. You can exit monitoring at any time with `Ctrl-C`

    ```sh
    $ sudo journalctl -f -u btcrpcexplorer
    ```

## Run BTC RPC Explorer

To keep an eye on the software movements, [start your SSH program](../system/remote-access.md#access-with-secure-shell) (eg. PuTTY) a second time, connect to the MiniBolt node, and log in as "admin". Commands for the **second session** start with the prompt `$2` (which must not be entered).

*   Start the service

    ```sh
    $2 sudo systemctl start btcrpcexplorer
    ```

Now point your browser to the secure access point provided by the NGINX web proxy, for example, `"https://minibolt.local:4000"` (or your node IP address) like `"https://192.168.0.20:4000"`. You should see the home page of BTC RPC Explorer.

Your browser will display a warning because we use a self-signed SSL certificate. We can do nothing about that because we would need a proper domain name (e.g., https://yournode.com) to get an official certificate that browsers recognize. Click on "Advanced" and proceed to the Block Explorer web interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you see a lot of errors on the MiniBolt command line, then Bitcoin Core might still be indexing the blockchain. You need to wait until reindexing is done before using the BTC RPC Explorer.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Congratulations!** You now have the BTC RPC Explorer running to check the Bitcoin network information directly from your node
{% endhint %}

## Extras

### **Slow device mode (resource-intensive features are disabled)**

*   With user `admin`, change to the `btcrpcexplorer` user

    ```sh
    $ sudo su - btcrpcexplorer
    ```
*   Edit the `.env` configuration file

    ```sh
    $ nano /home/btcrpcexplorer/btc-rpc-explorer/.env --linenumbers
    ```
*   Extend the timeout period due to the limited resources of your possible PC

    ```
    # uncomment and change the value of this line
    BTCEXP_BITCOIND_RPC_TIMEOUT=10000
    ```
*   Comment this line if it is uncommented (default value is **true**)

    ```
    #BTCEXP_SLOW_DEVICE_MODE=false
    ```

### **Sharing your Explorer**

You may want to share your BTC RPC Explorer **onion** address with confident people and limited Bitcoin Core RPC access requests (sensitive data requests will be kept disabled, don't trust, [verify](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer/blob/fc0c175e006dd7ff415f17a7b0e200f8a4cd5cf0/app/config.js#L131-L204). Enabling "DEMO" mode, you will not have to provide a password, and RPC requests will be allowed (discarding rpcBlacklist commands).

*   With user `admin`, change to the `btcrpcexplorer` user

    ```sh
    $ sudo su - btcrpcexplorer
    ```
*   Edit the `.env` configuration file

    ```sh
    $ nano /home/btcrpcexplorer/btc-rpc-explorer/.env --linenumbers
    ```

    ```
    # uncomment this line
    BTCEXP_DEMO=true
    ```

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to give them the `password [D]` if you added password protection in the reference step.
{% endhint %}

### **Remote access over Tor (optional)**

Do you want to access your personal blockchain explorer remotely? You can easily do so by adding a Tor hidden service on the MiniBolt and accessing the BTC RPC Explorer with the Tor browser from any device.

*   Add the following three lines in the "location-hidden services" section in the `torrc` file. Save and exit.

    ```sh
    $ sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
    ```

    ```
    ############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###
    # Hidden Service BTC RPC Explorer
    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_btcrpcexplorer/
    HiddenServiceVersion 3
    HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:3002
    ```
*   Reload the Tor configuration

    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl reload tor
    ```
*   Get your connection address

    ```sh
    $ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_btcrpcexplorer/hostname
    ```

**Example** of expected output:

```
> abcdefg..............xyz.onion
```

* With the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org), you can access this onion address from any device.

## For the future: BTC RPC Explorer update

Updating to a [new release](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer/releases) is straightforward, but make sure to check out the [change log](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) first.

*   From user "admin", stop the service and open a "btcrpcexplorer" user session

    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl stop btcrpcexplorer
    ```

    ```sh
    $ sudo su - btcrpcexplorer
    ```
